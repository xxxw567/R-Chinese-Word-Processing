Some useful tools are needed to analyzing those Chinese document. Hence the aim of current R package

##1.Websites of legal documents
* [Offical website](http://wenshu.court.gov.cn/)
* [OpenLaw](http://openlaw.cn/)

## 5.install all the functions
```{r eval = FALSE}

library(RCurl)

#install the read all function in my github repostroies
script <- getURL("https://github.com/xxxw567/R-Chinese-Word-Processing/blob/master/fun_install_github.R", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
eval(parse(text = script))
 
# install all the function in my repostroies

fun_install_github("https://github.com/xxxw567/R-Chinese-Word-Processing/tree/master/R")

```
